Docflow: Python Document Workflows
==================================

Docflow is an implementation of document workflows in Python. A workflow
defines `states` and `transitions`. A state is an "end point" associated with
a document. A transition is a path from one state to another state
(unidirectional). Docflow was inspired by `repoze.workflow`_ but aspires
to be a framework-independent implementation.
